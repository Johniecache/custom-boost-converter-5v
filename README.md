# custom-boost-converter-5v
This is a custom boost converter that takes in a specific voltage of roughly 3.7v and outputs roughly 5v. This takes into account the ripples of the system as well as the changing voltage of the battery as it decreases in stored energy. This is specifically for any of the 18650 or the 21700 battery cells.
